          "The approach was to embed a WebView2 host inside the desktop CRM and move screens to the web one at a time, rather than rewriting the whole desktop app at once. Each screen could go live as soon as its port was done, instead of waiting on one big release.",

          "The month view originally fetched an entire month's reservations in one request. I replaced that with per-week cached requests, which improved query performance as the migration grew.",
          "Because the web app runs inside a desktop webview, I also built the runtime foundation alongside the screens: refresh-token authentication, a bridge for events like settings changes between desktop and web, and pinned WebView2 runtime deployment after recurring runtime errors on certain hospital PCs.",

Building the API first and the web app in isolation before wiring it into the desktop webview kept all three ports fast and consistent.",
